* Class :
.It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions,
.which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is
.like a blueprint for an object.

.An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but
.when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

* Accessing data members:
.The data members and member functions of class can be accessed using the dot(‘.’)
.operator with the object.

* Access Control and Access Modifiers:
.Accessing a data member depends solely on the access control of that data member.
.This access control is given by Access modifiers in C++. There are three access
.modifiers : public, private and protected.

* Defining a member function outside of a class:
.To define a member function outside the class definition we have to use the scope
.resolution :: operator along with class name and function name.

* Friend Function:
.Friend function is a non member function which has access to private members.

* Constructors:
.Constructors are special class members which are called by the compiler every
.time an object of that class is instantiated. Constructors have the same name as
.the class and may be defined inside or outside the class definition.
